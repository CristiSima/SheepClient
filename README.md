# Sheep Client

The _best_~~(if you ignore all the others)~~ minecraft _utility_ client. :}  
Developed for LiveOverflow's [Minecraft:Hacked](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhixgUqwRTjwvBI-hmbZ2rpkAl4lutnJG) series/server.

**Version: 1.19.4**

### Features:
- **Position Precision**: don't waste your time with all the digits in the player's position, limit them to just 2
- **Fly**: _I believe I can do it_
- **No Fall Dmg**: your feet will never hurt again
- **No Position Packets**: why should the server know where you are?
- **Fix Position**: In case you accidentally add those useless decimals to your player's position
- **Cat Eyes**: Normal ppl can't see in the dark, script kiddies disabled darkness, you however have absolute control over light and darkness
- **Demo?**: let me demonstrate what I can actually do
- **Creative?**: Don't lie to me, you sneaky server, my creativity comes from the brain not your gamemode.
- **xRay**: now with 100% less radiation exposure, but you might need to blink a few times
- **Uneventful Move**: Just moving, nothing special, nothing to see here, no reason to get trigger, unless you are looking over the server logs

There is also a junky auto reconnect.

#### Quick notes:
- dying while using **Uneventful Move** require a reconnect
- **xRay** need a manual chunk reload(F3+A)
- **Uneventful Move** and **No Position Packets** will temporarily disable **Position Precision**, use **Fix Position**.
